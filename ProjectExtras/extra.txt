SOLID princles used
single responsibility: each class is in charge of one thing

open/closed:changing the event class does not require changing the U.I classes (except for how data is passed between them)
or dependent classes like day or calendar. 

Liskov substitution principle: event takes in a Series, which has subclasses DurationSeries and linked series. When creating
events, the subclasses are passed in

interface segregation: classes such as EventManager only depend on the create event method in calendar

dependency inversion: classes like calendar, event, month don't depend on any of the U.I classes


Design patterns:
dependency injection:
In the calendar class when an event is added, the object itself is passed instead of the parameters for event
The event class gets alerts and series that are already created passed to it
How the code improved since phase 1:
One improvement is that there is no longer a hugh 1000 line controller class. Now, each menu is broken up into its own class.
Another improvement is using a database instead of Json formatted txt files. Before, each calendar was stored in its own text 
file which made reading hard to manage. Now in the database, each user has related calendars and each calendar has related events
-EventMananger serves as a middle-man between the user interface and the calendar class, to facilitate adding repeated avents
and alerts

Features added
-android
-user can view by month, week, or day
-upon clicking a day, you can view its events, and choose to delete them
